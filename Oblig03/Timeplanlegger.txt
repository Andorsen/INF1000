Oppgave 3.1
a)
start1 == 10, slutt1 == 12, start2 == 11, slutt2 == 13
if(slutt1<=start2 || slutt2<=start1)
if(12<=11 or 13<=10) neither are true, if-test fails
do code in else block

b)
start1 == 10, slutt1 == 11, start2 == 12, slutt2 == 13
if(slutt1<=start2 || slutt2<=start1)
if(11<=12 or 13<=10) 11<=12 is true, if-test passes
do code in if block

c)
-Verify that startN is before sluttN(unless date changes during class...)
-Verify that recieved int is a valid time stamp, 1189 does not exist
-Set lower limit for duration, e.g.: start 1100 slutt 1102 is useless
-Maby set upper limit for duration, please no 16H classes
-Show error or Alert if classes is outside normal working hours
-Show alert if time between classes is shorter than some amount
